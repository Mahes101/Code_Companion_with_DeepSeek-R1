The goal of this project is to develop a Generative AI application using:

Ollama: To run and manage LLMs locally.

Deep Seek R1 LLM: A custom or pre-trained LLM for generating text.

LangChain: To integrate the LLM into a structured workflow.

Workflow Steps
1. Project Setup
Install Ollama:

Follow the installation steps for your operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL).

2. Install Required Libraries:
3. Download Deep Seek R1 LLM:

If Deep Seek R1 is available as a model file, download it.

If it’s a custom model, ensure it’s compatible with Ollama or Hugging Face.

4. Integrate Ollama with LangChain
5. Build the Application Workflow
6. Deploy the Application
7.  Monitor and Optimize
